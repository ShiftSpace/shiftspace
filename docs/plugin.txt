Plugin Issues When Developing With ShiftSpace
================================================================================

Some issues you may run into when developing a space intended to run
under the GreaseMonkey plugin version of ShiftSpace.


  z-index
  --------------------------------------------------
  Many sites will use fairly large z-index values. You will need to
  pick a sufficient large z-index if you do not want your page
  modifications to be obscured by content on the page. ShiftSpace has
  three many UI components, the notifier, the space menu, and the
  console. The console is at z-index 1000000, the notifier at
  1000001, the space menu at 1000002.


  frames
  --------------------------------------------------
  CSS on the page will invariably interact with your CSS. You should
  not create DOM nodes using Element, rather you should use
  ShifSpace.Element. It's a little bit more to type but we add a
  fairly aggressive CSS reset. Even this won't save you from CSS
  conflicts with complex stylesheeets. If you really want to protect
  your shift or space from the page CSS you should subclass
  SSFramedView. Refer to the API document for usage.


  encoding
  --------------------------------------------------
  in order to preserve the default encoding you will also need to put
  your input fields in an iframe. We're considering providing a
  generic framed input class.
