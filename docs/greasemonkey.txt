GreaseMonkey Issues
================================================================================

If you are attempting to build a version of ShiftSpace to run under
GreaseMonkey you should aware of some issues. 


  GreaseMonkey API
  --------------------------------------------------
  1. You cannot call into GM_* functions from eval'ed code. The
     workaround is that ShiftSpace has modified Function.prototype to
     include safeCall and safeCallWithResult. If you know that there
     is a GM_* api function anywhere in your eval'ed code call chain
     you must use one of these two variants. safeCallWithResult takes
     a callback function.


  DOM Issues
  --------------------------------------------------
  1. You must wrap event.target with a call to $().

  2. DOM nodes are wrapped in such a way that the JS Engine in Firefox
     will believe that it is looking at two different DOM nodes when they
     are in fact identical. In order to work around this it's best to
     use CSS ids, of course this means you were wise enought to not
     reuse CSS ids. Some nodes are won't giving an id, in this case
     you'll want to call _ssgenId on each element, this creates a
     random id.

  3. Do not hold onto window or document references because they are
     not real references, they are always native wrapper referenceds.
     They will be garbage collected right under you. This means you'll
     need to always directly access with element.ownerDocument or
     elemetn.ownerDocument.window and wrap these as well! MooTools
     makes this easy with the Element.getDocument() as well as
     Element.getWindow(). Look at GMMods to get a feeling for what
     needs to be done to make this work.
