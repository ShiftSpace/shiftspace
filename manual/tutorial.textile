h2. Getting started

This tutorial will guide you through building what is perhaps the
simplest Space that you can make: HelloWorld. The HelloWorld space,
when completed, will allow you to add the words 'Hello World!' as a
Shift to any page on the web. Potentially, anyone else who has
ShiftSpace installed will be able to see your message if they happen
to discover it on a page.

But before we begin, make sure you're running
"Firefox":http://mozilla.com, that you've "installed the ShiftSpace
development environment":install.html, that you have "Greasemonkey
enabled":http://greasespot.net and that you've installed the
development userscript (this is available from the ShiftSpace status
page, which might have a URL something like this:
<tt>http://localhost/shiftspace/shiftspace.php</tt>). You also need to
install the "Firebug extension":http://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1843
for Firefox. You currently need it for installing and uninstalling
spaces (until we build a proper user interface) and it will also prove
invaluable for debugging.

Finally, point your browser at the ShiftSpace Developer Sandbox.  This
will probably be something like
http://localhost/~yourusername/ShiftSpaceInstallDir/sandbox/index.php.
