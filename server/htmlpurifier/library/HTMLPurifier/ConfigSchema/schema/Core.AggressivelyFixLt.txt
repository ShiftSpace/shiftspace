Core.AggressivelyFixLt
TYPE: bool
VERSION: 2.1.0
DEFAULT: false
--DESCRIPTION--

This directive enables aggressive pre-filter fixes HTML Purifier can
perform in order to ensure that open angled-brackets do not get killed
during parsing stage. Enabling this will result in two preg_replace_callback
calls and one preg_replace call for every bit of HTML passed through here.
It is not necessary and will have no effect for PHP 4.
