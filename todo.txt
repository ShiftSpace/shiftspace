TODOS
================================================================================

1. SSConsole list views all load their content during SSConsole.show
   The issue is that we import stylesheets. 
   One trick would be to load the single style sheet so that it is ready
   and then load the individual ones to get the accurate line numbers.

2. SSSpaceMenu sometimes stays open blocking access to some of the tabs

3. Deploy only fixes part of the problem, we still don't see shifts right
   when the console loads.
   This is because show get called on the view before the view is awake.
   All of these kinds of things are avoided when we just load everything
   right away because of the time it takes the user to get to actually
   opening the console.

   UPDATE: only AllShiftsView and GroupsPane don't work properly
   MyShiftSpace seems fine.
