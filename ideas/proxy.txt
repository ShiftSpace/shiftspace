Proxy Issues
================================================================================
Some issues and thoughts relevant to the proxy.


  Usability 
  ------------------------------ 
  In order to allow normal execution of page scripts, ShiftSpace
  should run in a frame outside of the page.

  Web developers often interact with the DOM by directly calling
  methods or properties on the global document and window
  objects. Such techniques will not work under the proxy. Space who
  wish for their extensions to work under the proxy will need to call
  SSDocument() and SSWindow(). 

  Unfortunately this also means that most open source JavaScript
  libraries will not work without a bit of intelligent search and
  replace, for large codebases this will be a non-trivial amount of
  work.

  Any page can break ShiftSpace by talking across the iFrame barrier
  since the domains are the same. Nothing can be done about this.
  Framekillers can be prevented however.


  Security 
  ------------------------------ 
  We cannot use real user session cookies when a user is viewing a
  page on the proxy. These can be stolen. Cookied will be invalid on
  the proxy path.  When a user attempts to access a private shift,
  they should enter their credentials.  The server will give the user
  a unique md5 hashed url. This url will be very difficult to discover,
  but no further security is provided.
